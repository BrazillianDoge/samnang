        <p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-69420</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Object Class:</b> Apollyon</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Special Conatinment Procedures:</b> SCP-69420 is to be kept inside a school named SISC(Southbridge International School of Cambodia). Personnel must check their lunches to see if SCP-69420 has farted in their lunch. If so, then they must not eat it otherwise the sheer deliciousness of the lunch will immediately kill said personnel. SCP-69420's kidnapped children (which are kept in it's basement) must be kept alive at all cost otherwise SCP-69420 will kidnap other children and do a Fortnite dance over the dead bodies of the children.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> SCP-69420 is a tall, humanoid figure that has, as many employees have said, a "Skibidi" face. SCP-69420 has the uncanny ability to do a dance where it grabs it's knees and starts crossing them. Every 23 milliseconds, SCP-69420 will fart in someone random's lunch. This will make the lunch taste so good that it will immediately terminate whoever eats it. SCP-69420 also owns children which are kept at the third floor of the school it is contained within. If these children die, SCP-69420 will proceed to Fortnite dance over their dead bodies and then find new children. These Fortnite dances may cause immense cringe, killing all people wihin a 69.420 mile radius.</p>
